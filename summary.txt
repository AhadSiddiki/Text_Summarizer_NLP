SpaceX, the private rocket company, is developing a robotic system to recover and reuse its Super Heavy rocket booster after a launch, which could radically change the way space missions are launched and reusability is achieved, according to the company’s founder and chief executive officer, Elon Musk, who unveiled the concept at the International Space Station (ISS) conference in March. If the catcher system proves successful, it could enable a rapid launch turnaround—possibly within hours—making Starship the first fully reusable rocket system capable of frequent space launches.
